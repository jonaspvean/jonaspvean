Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Current foci and areas of interest:
- Nonlinear partial differential equations of nonlocal type
- Numerical and stochastic analysis applied to nonlinear phenomena such as water waves
- Symmetry analysis Ã  la Lie applied to PDEs of nonlocal evolution equations 

Programming interests and further learning goals:
- Machine learning, data analysis, numerical analysis, and symbolic calculus in Python
- Modelling and simulation of PDE-inspired work in C++
- Light frontend development with JavaScript/TypeScript with some React and Bootstrap thrown in
