## Jonas Pedersen Vean

<!--
**jonaspvean/jonaspvean** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Current foci and areas of interest:
- Nonlinear partial differential equations of nonlocal type
- Numerical and stochastic analysis applied to nonlinear phenomena such as water waves
- Symmetry analysis à la Lie applied to PDEs of nonlocal evolution equations 

Programming interests and further learning goals:
- Machine learning, numerical analysis and symbolic calculus in Python
- Modelling and simulation of PDE-inspired work in C++
- Light frontend development with JavaScript/TypeScript with some React and Bootstrap thrown in
